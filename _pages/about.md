I'm a Graduate Research Assistant at the Multimedia Lab in the University of Toronto, where I work on computer vision and deep learning applied to computational pathology. I obtained both my Master's (2020) and Bachelor's (2017) degrees in Electrical Engineering at the University of Toronto and worked on video post-processing at Qualcomm for a year.

My thesis research focuses on weakly-supervised semantic segmentation of histological tissue type from digital pathology images. My other research interests include: abnormality detection, image classification, and machine learning.
