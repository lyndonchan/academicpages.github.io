I'm a Master's student at the Multimedia Lab in the University of Toronto, where I work on computer vision and deep learning applied to computational pathology. I studied my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering at the University of Toronto and worked on video post-processing at Qualcomm for a year.

My thesis research focuses on weakly-supervised semantic segmentation of histological tissue type from digital pathology images. My other research interests include: abnormality detection, human prior knowledge transfer, image enhancement, and image understanding.
