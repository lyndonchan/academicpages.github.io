I'm a Master's student at the Multimedia Lab in the University of Toronto, where I work on computater vision and deep learning mainly applied to computational pathology. Previously, I studied my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering at the University of Toronto and interned at Qualcomm where I worked in video post-processing, video enhancement, and image compression standards. My research interests include: augmented intelligence, weakly-supervised object localization, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), abnormality detection, human prior knowledge transfer, image enhancement, and image understanding.
