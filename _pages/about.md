I'm currently a Data Scientist at the start-up Alphabyte Solutions. Formerly, I was a Graduate Researcher at the Multimedia Lab in the University of Toronto, where I worked on computer vision applied to computational pathology. I obtained both my Master's (2020) and Bachelor's (2017) degrees in Electrical Engineering at the University of Toronto and worked on video post-processing at Qualcomm for a year.

My thesis research focused on weakly-supervised semantic segmentation of histological tissue type from digital pathology images. My current technical interests include: natural language processing, image classification, time-series forecasting, and other sorts of machine learning.
