I'm currently an Applied Researcher at Avidbots Corp, where I work on deep learning perception for autonomous cleaning robots. Formerly, I was a Data Scientist at Alphabyte Solutions, where I worked on ad spend analytics, house price prediction, and developed a parliamentary summarizing site called <a href="https://www.parlawatch.ai/">Parlawatch</a>. I obtained my Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Toronto, researching weakly-supervised semantic segmentation of pathology images.

My current technical interests include: computer vision, robot perception, autonomous navigation, simulation, and natural language processing.
